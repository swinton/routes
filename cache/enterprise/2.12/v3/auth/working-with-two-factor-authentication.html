<p>For users with two-factor authentication enabled, Basic Authentication requires
an extra step. When you attempt to authenticate with Basic Authentication, the
server will respond with a <code>401</code> and an <code>X-GitHub-OTP: required; :2fa-type</code>
header. This indicates that a two-factor authentication code is needed (in
addition to the username and password). The <code>:2fa-type</code> in this header indicates
whether the account receives its two-factor authentication codes via SMS or via
an application.</p>
<p>In addition to the Basic Authentication credentials, you must send the user&apos;s
authentication code (i.e., one-time password) in the <code>X-GitHub-OTP</code> header.
Because these authentication codes expire quickly, we recommend using the
Authorizations API to <a href="/enterprise/2.12/v3/oauth_authorizations/#create-a-new-authorization">create an access token</a> and using that
token to <a href="/enterprise/2.12/v3/#authentication">authenticate via OAuth</a> for most API access.</p>
<p>Alternately, you can create access tokens from the Personal Access Token <a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens">settings page</a>.</p>
