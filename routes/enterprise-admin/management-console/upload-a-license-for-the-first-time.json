This can be accomplished two ways:\n\n1.  If you're working directly with the API before accessing the web interface, you must pass in the password parameter to set your password.\n2.  If you set up your instance via the web interface before accessing the API, your calls to this endpoint do not need the password parameter.\n\nFor a list of the available settings, see the [Retrieve settings endpoint](#retrieve-settings).",
