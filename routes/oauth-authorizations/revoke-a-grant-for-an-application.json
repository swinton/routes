  "description": "OAuth application owners can revoke a grant for their OAuth application and a specific user. You must use [Basic Authentication](/enterprise/2.12/v3/auth#basic-authentication) for this method, where the username is the OAuth application `client_id` and the password is its `client_secret`. You must also provide a valid token as `:token` and the grant for the token's owner will be deleted.\n\nDeleting an OAuth application's grant will also delete all OAuth tokens associated with the application for the user. Once deleted, the application will have no access to the user's account and will no longer be listed on [the application authorizations settings screen within GitHub](https://github.com/settings/applications#authorized).",
