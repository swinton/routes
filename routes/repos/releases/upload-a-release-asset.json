Everything else about the endpoint is the same as the rest of the API. For example, you'll still need to pass your authentication to be able to upload an asset.\n\nSend the raw binary content of the asset as the request body.\n\nThis may leave an empty asset with a state of `\"new\"`. It can be safely deleted.",
