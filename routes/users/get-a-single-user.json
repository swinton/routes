When setting up your profile, you can select a primary email address to be “public” which provides an email entry for this endpoint. If you do not set a public email address for `email`, then it will have a value of `null`. You only see publicly visible email addresses when authenticated with GitHub Enterprise. For more information, see [Authentication](/enterprise/2.12/v3/#authentication).\n\nThe Emails API enables you to list all of your email addresses, and toggle a primary email to be visible publicly.
